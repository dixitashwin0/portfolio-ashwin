            I remember being called “one of the notorious boys” but never faced it’s repercussions as I was also called”boy who studies and does his work properly”.This childhood memory has always made me feel confident and self motivated. It also gave a sense of inner satisfaction.Talks about Tech and Mech.Talks about skills and developments.Talks about poetry and sports(chiefly football and snooker).
            *I prefer ‘Eating the frog’ technique to complete my tasks.
